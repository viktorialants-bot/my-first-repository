# Viktoria Lants — IT & Network Specialist

## 🌐 About Me
I am an ambitious systems and network administrator with practical experience in
network configuration, troubleshooting, and security. I am currently completing a final training course in theoretical and practical  work at Cisco CCNP-level (series 201-300) to improve my
skills in the field of corporate networks and cybersecurity.

I enjoy working on practical labs in Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3, building  
networks from scratch, and documenting solutions. My goal is to join a  
forward-thinking IT company as a **SysAdmin / Network Engineer Intern** and  
grow into a full-time professional role.
