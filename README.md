# Viktoria Lants — IT & Network Specialist

## 🌐 About Me
I am an aspiring **System & Network Administrator** with hands-on experience in  
network configuration, troubleshooting, and security. Currently preparing for the  
**Cisco CCNP ENCOR 350-401 / CCNP-level labs (201-300 series)** to strengthen my  
skills in enterprise networking and cybersecurity.

I enjoy working on practical labs in Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3, building  
networks from scratch, and documenting solutions. My goal is to join a  
forward-thinking IT company as a **SysAdmin / Network Engineer Intern** and  
grow into a full-time professional role.
